# Text-Adventure

**Text-Adventure** is a simple console-based adventure game written in C#, where the player navigates through rooms, encounters events, collects items and makes decisions that affect the outcome. It’s designed as a learning / portfolio project — showcasing basic game logic, object-oriented design, and user interaction in a terminal environment.

## 🧠 Motivation  
I created this project to practise core programming concepts like classes, control flow, input/output, and game logic — and to build a small but complete, playable application from scratch. It’s also useful as a demonstration of how I approach problem-solving and project structure in C#.

## 🚀 Features  
- Room navigation — move between different “rooms” or states.  
- Interactive text-based events / choices.  
- Item management (pickup, inventory) and simple state tracking.  
- Basic game loop with win/lose conditions.  
- Easy to extend — can add more rooms, events, items, or branching logic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Platform:** .NET / Console Application
